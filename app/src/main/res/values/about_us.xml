    <string name="about_us">
        India is a highly under-penetrated country in terms of insurance and most Indians are either un-insured or are under-insured. One of the reasons for low levels of insurance outreach is customers inability to pay full insurance premium upfront. As a result , people and enterprises suffer huge fianacial losses arising out of mishappenings most of which are insurable. Our objective is to make insurance accessible to individuals, households and enterprises. With a view to encourage purchase of insurance policies by those who cannot pay insurance premiums upfront and require instalment facility, we have tied up with banks which provide loans to such customers. On the other hand we have partnered insurance companies in order to make financing of insurance premium a seamless experience for customers. In order to reach out to the customers across the country, we have institutions and individuals as our channel partners. We are a resource organization which represents the lenders and manages the lending process end-to-end which includes customer acquisition and servicing, management of processes / data / documents and interface with various stakeholders for backend activities. Currently financing of insurance premium is carried through our Business Associates using a B2B mobile app. Shortly, customers shall be able to apply and transact online through our portal and B2C mobile app. We are not a bank or a NBFC or an insurance intermediary.
